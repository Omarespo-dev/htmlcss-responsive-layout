                <p><img src="./img/tiramisu.jpg" alt="Tiramisu">Back in the day, grandmothers used to prepare a breakfast that we might call humble today, but was considered very rich at the time! Today the recipe is still unchanged, just break a very fresh egg into a glass, beat it with sugar, ana add coffee or hot milk, for children, or Marsala wine or aniseed for adults. This marvelous cream gave rise to mascarpone cream used to make Tiramis (mascarpone cheese and ladyfingers dessert). This is the best Italian dessert, the most popular ana beloved of them all, and it has also birthed many other versions, even an egg-free Tiramisu! There is also a strawberry and Nutella tiramisu!
                Although the origins of this famousedessert are unclear, because it is disputed between the regions of Veneto,
                Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Piedmont, and Tuscany, it remains a cornerstone of Italian cuisine and it's widely prepared from
                North to South. Unfortunately, we werent able to find out who invented it, but we can certainly teach you how to prepare your best tiramisu ever. So heres the recipe: try it
                and let us know what you think!
